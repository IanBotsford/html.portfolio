<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a student at Conestoga College who is taking this Udemy course on full
  stack web development. I have autism and schizophrenia. My schizophrenic
  experience mostly has to do with delusions and thought broadcasting. I had a
  bout of psychosis that lasted for 6 months and negative symptoms that were
  present prior to the psychosis. I like to play video games and learn things. I
  don't use chatGPT to cheat.
